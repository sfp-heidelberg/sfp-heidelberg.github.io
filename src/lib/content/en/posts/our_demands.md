# Our Demands

We, the students of the academic institutions in Heidelberg, demand:

1. **Recognition and condemnation of the genocide** against the Palestinian people by the Israeli government and the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and **calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire**.

2. **Measures to Prevent Complicity in the Genocide**

   1. Full and comprehensive **disclosure of the funding partners** of all educational and research institutions in Heidelberg (including philanthropic funding).

   2. **Review** of these funding partners with regard to **compliance with human rights and international law** and immediate cessation of cooperation in the event of violations of human rights and international law.

   3. Immediate **termination of cooperation** between all educational and research institutions in Heidelberg and Israeli academic institutions that are complicit in the genocide and the illegal occupation of Palestine.

3. **Solidarity** with Palestine

   1. Immediate measures to **support Palestinian students and staff** in the admission to Heidelberg as well as creating safe spaces.

   2. Establishment and enlargement of **academic cooperation** between educational and research institutions in Heidelberg and Palestine, for example in the form of research collaborations, study exchange and scholarship programmes.

4. **Free Academic Discourse on Antisemitism and (Anti-Muslim) Racism**

   1. **Free and scientific discussion** about antisemitism, (anti-Muslim) racism and colonialism at Heidelberg University and Hochschule für Jüdischen Studien as well as continuous interdisciplinary seminars on Palestine research and the (historical) realities of Palestinian life.

   2. **Rejection of the instrumentalisation and abuse of the concept antisemitism** through the use of the IHRA working definition (in particular by equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism) as well as the promotion of disinformation and propaganda.

   3. Review and structural reform of university measures against discrimination at educational and research institutions in Heidelberg.
