We, the Students of Heidelberg have come together to:

**stand in solidarity** with the Palestinian people, Palestinian students and with the global student movement. 

**condemn** the Israeli Apartheid regime, its ongoing genocidal campaign in Gaza, and the ongoing settler-colinialism in Palestine since the Nakba of 1948;  as well as the complicity of society, governments and insitutions allied with the State of Israel.

**express** our deep hurt and outrage for the dehumanisation of Palestinian people and their suffering, and the erasure of their realities from the public discussion and academia.

Therefore, we

engage in **critical conversations** about the Palestinian cause,

reflect on **discourses in Germany** about Israel and Palestine,

**act against** all forms of discrimination and oppression.

**Justice, peace, freedom for Palestine and for all oppressed peoples of the world!**
